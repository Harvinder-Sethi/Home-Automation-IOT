# Home-Automation-IOT

A Mini Home Automation System.

Key Learnings: A Home Automation system using Arduino Genuino (An open-source electronic prototyping platform enabling users to create interactive electronic objects), in which  I have used 2-Relays,1 Bluetooth module, a self-made Android Application, a bulb, fan, room temperature and  humidity sensor, servo motor, water level indicator sensor, ir sensor, rain water indication sensor. we can switch on and off any appliance accordingly via the android application, control room temperature, lock unlock doors, rain alarm, fire alarm and much more.

NOTE:- You can download the android application and the script files and play the video with it to learn more.
